Python Symbolic Execution

# Disclaimer
This is just for me to mess around with symbolic execution of python scripts. Likely not going to work/be broken so probably not something you care to play with.

# Install
Basic installation requires installing z3 with python bindings. It's recommended to install this into a python virtualenv to keep things a bit more clean.

I created a setup script. It works on Ubuntu 15.04. It is untested on other releases.

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

# Tests
Tests need to be done from somewhere that has z3 access. For my env, this means the virtual environment.

```bash
$ workon pySym
(z3)$ py.test --cov=. --cov-config=.coveragerc
```
