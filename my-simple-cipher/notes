TODO:
 - [DONE] Add assert handling
   - tests
 - Add string.encode('hex') handling
   - tests
 - [DONE] Add pySym project class (just to make things easier to load)
   - [DONE] tests
 - [DONE] Implement random.randint
   - [DONE] tests
 - [DONE] Implement symbolic Char for ord
   - [DONE] tests
 - [DONE] Implement __int__ for Int object
   - [DONE] tests
 - Add support in resolveObject for ast.NameConstant (True, False, None, others?)
   - tests
 - Add support for _ast.BoolOp in Assert (assert True and True)
   - tests
 - Check BitVecs to use ULE/UGT/etc if doing compare. It defaults to signed.
 - [DONE] Change Char bitvec size to 8...
   - Or really just change char to be a constrained int...
   - Need to pull all Char sets into the object. I.e.: Externally, only use Char.setTo
   - Implement logic in Char.setTo to add bound constraints to the solver if we are adding to the solver and don't have those constraints already.
   - Instantiate Char internally as an Int instead of a BitVec
   - On getZ3Var method for Char, ensure that the constraints are in the solver. This could end up producing excess constraints, but...
   - [DONE] Change it to utilize bounded Int instead. I'm not happy about this. It will slow things down. :-(
 - [DONE] Update Int to handle setTo of Z3 expression
   - [DONE] Update symbolic ord function to use this
   - tests
 - Implement max
   - tests
   - doc
 - [DONE] Create "remove_constraints" method of pyState
   - Basically it will just create a new solver with any of those constraints not in it
   - [DONE] doc
   - [DONE] test
 - [DONE] Implement chr (fully)
   - [DONE] tests
   - [DONE] doc
 - Update docs
 - Add options ability. Be able to specify options on proj build
 - Add option to run simplification passes
   - t = z3.Tactic('ctx-solver-simplify')
   - t(z3.And(*s.solver.assertions()))[0] # These would be the new solver assertions. Do on copy?
 - [DONE] Add static optimization for Char.
   - [DONE] If we're setting to static, remove the bounds from solver.
   - Further, check if we're relying on any other variable. If not, fully remove this variable from the solver and store it in pyObjectManager object.
 - pyObjectManager getVar ends up double creating a new value.
   - __init__ creates one, then Ctx setitem ends up creating a duplicate of that one... This is wasteful.
 - [DONE] Add uuid and clone_uuid to other objects
   - [DONE] Char
   - [DONE] String
   - [DONE] BitVec
   - [DONE] List
   - [DONE] tests
 - Create "find_by_uuid" for pyObjectManager to return object with that uuid.
 - Capture reference counts to the variables. When they get to zero, if the only thing in the solver is Char's bounds, remove it.
 - [DONE] Recursive copy still ending up in the solver...
 - [DONE] Remove increment option from getZ3Object
 - Returning of type None from functions is failing.
   - tests
 - [DONE] Update pyState.remove_constraints to check that constraints exist in solver before attempting to remove. Removing is COSTLY!
 - [DONE] Add is_unconstrained
   - Int
   - Char (treat base char constraints as unconstrained)
   - BitVec
 - [DONE] Add is_unconstrained handling to setTo of Char. If Char itself is unconstrained and setting to another Char object, then use clone approch
 - Double check that all functions are using the variables state, rather than their own!!!
   - Somehow make sure this always happens... If we're not doing it this way, constraints will just disappear on us.
 - Add bytes ability to setTo of Char
 - Add compare left var string support (i.e.: assert s[0] == 12).
   - probably need to add right var for that too
 - Add ability to resolve a function as an argument. i.e.:
    def test(x):
        x()
    def test2():
        blerg
    test(test2)
 - [DONE] All grabbing of variables from out of function inside function
    q = 12
    def test():
        print(q)
    test()
 - for (x,y) in zip(l1, l2) doesn't work.
 - Implement List.setTo for non-clear.
 - Handle var referenced before assignment.. Right now it will happily set.
    q = 12
    def test():
        q += 4
    This should end in an error
