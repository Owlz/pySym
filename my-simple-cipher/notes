TODO:
 - Add assert handling
   - tests
 - Add string.encode('hex') handling
   - tests
 - [DONE] Add pySym project class (just to make things easier to load)
   - [DONE] tests
 - Implement random.randint
   - tests
 - [DONE] Implement symbolic Char for ord
   - [DONE] tests
 - [DONE] Implement __int__ for Int object
   - [DONE] tests
 - Add support in resolveObject for ast.NameConstant (True, False, None, others?)
   - tests
 - Add support for _ast.BoolOp in Assert (assert True and True)
   - tests
 - Check BitVecs to use ULE/UGT/etc if doing compare. It defaults to signed.
 - Change Char bitvec size to 8...
   - Or really just change char to be a constrained int...
   - Need to pull all Char sets into the object. I.e.: Externally, only use Char.setTo
   - Implement logic in Char.setTo to add bound constraints to the solver if we are adding to the solver and don't have those constraints already.
   - Instantiate Char internally as an Int instead of a BitVec
   - On getZ3Var method for Char, ensure that the constraints are in the solver. This could end up producing excess constraints, but...
 - [DONE] Update Int to handle setTo of Z3 expression
   - [DONE] Update symbolic ord function to use this
   - tests
 - Implement max
   - tests
   - doc
 - Implement chr (fully)
   - tests
   - doc
 - Update docs
 - Get away from using recursive copy... It's SSA! Need to keep track of context somewhere outside the solver.
